# Pshare

My 15 Summer project is develop Pshare website. Those codes only built the website basic frame but they are work and very well. The basic main frame inluce the index page and upload, auto-classified info page that depend on the index page search require. For each item, there is a individual comment page for it. And for each item, there is rating system, like and dislike, but vote is restricted by IP address in case of fake repetitive voting. 

BTW, mm_menu.js is created by system server or other codes automatically.
